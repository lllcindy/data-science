    "## MapReduce Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce is conceptually very simple. Read the lecture notes, and optionally the [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) to understand it. Here's a summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Map function is called on each element of a list of inputs, producing a list of dictionaries. Each input (in any format) is converted to a dictionary from a key to some intermediate value. Once you figure out what a good intermediate value for the problem you're trying to solve, the Map and Reduce functions are usually obvious. \n",
    "2. The Partition function (sometimes called Shuffle or Collate) converts the produced list-of-dictionaries into a dictionary-of-lists. Each key/value pair in the output dictionay is sometimes called a Partition.\n",
    "3. The Reduce function converts each value in the dictionary-of-lists into a single value, making it a dictionary-of-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have to complete this implementation of MapReduce by filling in the partition function. We have included type hints, but you don't need them to complete this; you can optionally read more about them [here](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html)."

When Google released their [2004 MapReduce paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf), this was one of the use-cases they cited.\n",

    "The concept of an inverted index is central to any modern search engine. E.g., given a query \"X, Y\", where, we want to retrieve documents containing the words X or/and Y, the engine only needs to look at the union/intersection of the documents in the inverted indices of X and Y (which have been precomputed already)!\n",

    " - The input type is `Tuple[str, List[str]]`, corresponding to the file name and a list of words\n",
    " - The key type is `str`, corresponding to each word\n",
    " - The intermediate representation type is `List[Tuple[str, int]]`, which is a list of (filename, position) pairs\n",

    "## Reverse Web Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The world-wide web can be throught of as a directed graph, where the edge A → B encodes a link in page A that points to page B. We've previously covered adjacency matrices in this course; we can very easily construct a row in the adjacency matrix for each page by parsing each webpage and recording the outgoing links we observe in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we want the *reverse* adjacency list. For each webpage, we want the list of webpages which point to it (i.e., incoming links). This is the reverse webgraph problem, and we can solve this with MapReduce:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "The types in this problem are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The input type is `Tuple[str, bytes]`, corresponding to the URL and the raw bytes of the website\n",
    " - The key type is `Tuple[str, str]`, corresponding to the URL `netloc` and `path`. We explain these parts in the Hints section.\n",
    " - The intermediate type is up to you!\n",
    " - The output type is `Tuple[key, Dict[incoming_netloc, incoming_path]]`, where:\n",
    "     - `key` is a `Tuple[str, str]`, same as the key type.\n",
    "     - `incoming_netloc` is a `str` which has the `netloc` of the incoming links, and\n",
    "     - `incoming_path` is a `Set[str]` which is a set of `path`s following the associated `netloc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When constructing the index, we do not care how many links point from A to B.\n",
    "- You can choose any way to represent the data.\n",
    "- You should use `BeautifulSoup` to parse the webpage.\n",
    "    - Only search for URLs in tags like `<a href=\"...\">`.\n",
    "    - Only consider URLs ending in `.html`\n",
    "- URLs can be relative or absolute; you should use [`urlparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlparse) to extract the `netloc` and `path` to determine which path this is.\n",
    "    - If the URL is absolute (such as `http://cs.cornell.edu/Info/Courses/Current/CS415/CS414.html`), then `netloc` will not be blank. You can use the parsed `netloc` and `path` directly.\n",
    "    - If the URL is relative (such as `/Info/Courses/Current/CS415/CS414.html` or `CS414.html`), then `netloc` will be blank. You can assume the `netloc` of the target is the same as the `netloc` of the source, and:\n",
    "        - If the `path` has a leading `/`, then it is the complete path of the target.\n",
    "        - If the `path` does not have a leading `/`, you should replace the final path segment (i.e. everything after the final `/`) with the contents of `path`. You do not need to consider parent paths (i.e. `../`).\n",
    "- Not all target pages may appear in the source; this is alright.\n",
    "- Ignore the `Some characters could not be decoded, and were replaced with REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.` message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fiddly part of this problem is in handling URLs; we provide you with `canonicalize_url` and some tests which you can optionally use."

    "\n",

    "nodes = [...] # A collection of nodes\n",

    "        num_outgoing = len(e for e in edges if e is (source -> *))\n",

    "        pr[node] = update[node]*d + (1-d)/n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you should not actually use this algorithm for calculating this; that would be too slow. Instead, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Observe that your function is given `num_outgoing`, the number of outgoing edges from each node, and `incoming`, the source nodes that have edges ending in your nodes.\n",
    "2. Rewrite the above pseudocode to calculate the new pagerank for a single node using `incoming` rather than as shown in the pseudocode above.\n",
    "3. Implement this using PageRank (Additional hint: the reduce function is very simple! All the heavy lifting is done in the map function.)\n",
    "4. Verify that your algorithm is numerically correct on the small, and then the large test case provided.\n",
    "5. Time your algorithm and make sure it completes all tests in under 120s. The Optimization section has hints on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be a good idea to come to TA hours with pseudocode or ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges is making your code run quickly. We've already arranged the code so you should be able to meet the time requirement. Also, we will be evaluating your code on only a few iterations instead of 100 iterations. Ensure that your function takes under 120s on a modern laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some hints on optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. While you have sufficient information to solve the problem with the arguments to `pr_map`, you can significantly improve the speed by precomputing a little information. Feel free to change `gen` in `pagerank` to pass precomputed information to the workers.\n",
    "2. It may not be at all necessary to improve this, though, so submit your code once before trying to optimize it. \n",
    "3. We use the generator `gen` to bundle arguments to feed them to `mapreduce`. We are grouping the incoming nodes into chunks of `2**11 = 2048` nodes; we experimentally found that this balances the overhead of transferring data to the worker processes against the amount of work per chunk. You may change this. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that this method is much slower than that in Homework 2. It took about 6s to run all tests using the original sparse matrix implementation on a single core; this will take about a 60s to do the same on a 6-core machine. The main reasons for the slow-down are the setup time (in spawning new processes for the multiprocessing pool), the communication overhead (marshaling, sending data to each process, and unmarshaling it), and the use of the Python dictionary instead of heavily-optimized Numpy sparse matrix math.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "You should complete `pr_map` and `pr_reduce` (and optionally modify `pagerank`) to calculate the pagerank of nodes in the input graph, following the type signatures. 100 iterations of this should complete in under 120s. You may choose any intermediate representation (though a very simple one is sufficient to solve the problem)."
